# convergame-tech-demo
A testing game demo to display all of Convergame's features. Useful for testing new or existing functionality.  

## What is the tech demo for?

The Convergame Engine Tech Demo serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it is a way for Convergame Engine developers to test new functionality with ease, as new GitHub Pull Requests are created.

Secondly, the tech demo can showcase all of the features that Convergame currently support such as draw methods, audio and collision, to name a few examples.


## How do I use the tech demo?

When creating a new feature for the Convergame Engine fork this project as well as the engine repository. Make sure that you have created your scene under the correct category (For example, if you are expanding the audio functionality then ensure that your new audio feature can be accessed via the audio sub-menu). Keep new functionality separate in a newly created scene. 

It is recommended that you should add your Convergame Engine version as a git submodule and create a pull request in the [Convergame Engine Repository](https://github.com/convergame/convergame-engine) while linking to your own fork of this tech demo so we can check your changes against your copy of the tech demo. 

Any issues or inconsistencies with the tech demo then please raise a [new issue](https://github.com/convergame/convergame-tech-demo/issues) and we'll try to correct it as soon as possible.
